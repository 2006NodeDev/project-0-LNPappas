    # Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) API
    The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage 
    the process of reimbursing employees for expenses 
    incurred while on company time. All employees in the 
    company can login and submit requests for 
    reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending 
    requests. Finance managers can log in and view all 
    reimbursement requests and past history for all 
    employees in the company. Finance managers are 
    authorized to approve and deny requests for expense 
    reimbursement.
